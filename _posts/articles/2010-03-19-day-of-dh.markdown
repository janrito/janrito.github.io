Yesterday I took part of [Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities 2010](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities_2010). You can read [my entries](http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh2010/alejandrogiacometti), or browse the most [recent posts](http://ra.tapor.ualberta.ca/~dayofdh2010/).

The project is a digital publication that aims to answer the question: What does a digital humanist do? It is an interesting way of taking a snapshot of the community at a specific point in time. This is the second Day of DH, the first one was last year. I really hope this project continues to be carried out. I would like to see the evolution of DH in 10 years.

I also took some pictures and wrote about theÂ [decode](http://www.vam.ac.uk/microsites/decode/) exhibit at the Victoria & Albert Museum.
