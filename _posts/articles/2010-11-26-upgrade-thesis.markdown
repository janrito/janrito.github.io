![Transfer Thesis Wordle](/images/transfer-thesis-word-cloud.png)

Last friday, I had the transfer VIVA for to upgrade from MPhil to PhD student. My project consists of designing a phantom test to evaluate image processing methods on multi-spectral images of Palimpsestic documents. The examiners were [Prof. Daniel Alexander](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.alexander/) from [CMIC](http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) and [Simon Mahony](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/infostudies/simon-mahony/) from the [UCLDH](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/), they had some very insightful comments and suggestions. It is great finishing this phase of my research project.
