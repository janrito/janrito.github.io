I am a [Digital Humanist](dh)[^dh] -- which for me means that I get to play with technology in order to make it useful to research in the humanities. I work at the [Department of Digital Humanities](kcldh) at [King's College London][kcl].

I have a newly minted PhD in Image Science from [University College London][ucl], where I worked with my supervisors [Melissa Terras][] from the [Department of Information Studies][dis] and [UCL Centre for Digital
Humanities][ucldh] and [Adam Gibson][] from the [Department of Medical Physics][medphys]. My dissertation was on the application of an imaging method – Multispectral Imaging – to the recovery of writing from cultural heritage documents.

I also did an MA in [Humanities Computing][huco] with [Stan Ruecker][] at the [University of Alberta][uofa].  My research centred around an rich-prospect interface: the Texttiles Browser, an experiment in leveraging available metadata to visualise and browse medium sized text collections. My [thesis][mathesis] title is: *The Texttiles browser: an experiment in rich-prospect browsing for text collections*.

My research interests are imaging and digitisation of cultural heritage material, in particular the use of signal processing and analysis to enhance recovery. I am also interested in design, visualisation and interfaces to explore humanities datasets.

I grew up in Ecuador, and I sometimes like to [comment][] (in Spanish)
on the media, and the quality of its discourse. I have a special
[section][] on articles that have absolute disregard for journalistic
principles and are just a calculated litany of stories meant to generate
emotional reactions.

[^dh]:  
    Digital Humanities is an academic discipline which has had an extremely difficult time defining itself. In fact, every single digital humanities conference, event, workshop, colloquium, interview and informal discussion over coffee which I have attended has inevitably included a lengthy session on on what Digital Humanities means. 

    I am not interested in that discussion any more because; it prevents me from getting on to do more interesting stuff.
