Multispectral technology is used to capture a series of images centred at narrow bands of the visible and infrared spectrum, these data provides information about the physical characteristics of the imaged object. 

Multispectral imaging has been successfully utilised to recover damaged or obscured writing from cultural heritage documents, such as manuscripts and palimpsests.

My research investigates the computational methods used to process multispectral image data from manuscripts and recover their writing. 

In particular it aimed to produce an objective, quantitative metric of the success or failure of the recovery. 

I designed an experiment to deliberately damage samples of a deaccessioned 1753 manuscript using a variety of agents; each of those samples was imaged using multispectral technology before and after the damage occurred. 

The images of the damaged samples were then processed using the traditional methods of recovery, principal component analysis, independent component analysis and linear spectral mixture analysis. 

A metric based on mutual information was then proposed to compare the recovery images to the images before the damage occurred. 

For the majority of the procedures, I found that PCA produces the best recovery estimates, it produces images that are more similar to the images of the undamaged sample.
