I am a [Digital Humanities][] postgraduate student at [University College
London][]. My current research is on the application of medical image
processing methods to recover information from ancient damaged documents. My
advisors are  [Melissa Terras][] from the [Department of Information
Studies][] and [Adam Gibson][] from the [Department of Medical Physics and
Bioengineering][]. I am also affiliated to the [UCL Centre for Digital
Humanities][].

I recently finished my MA in [Humanities Computing][] under the supervision of
[Stan Ruecker][] at the [University of Alberta][].  My research centred around
an rich-prospect interface: the Texttiles Browser, an experiment in leveraging
available metadata to visualise and browse medium sized text collections. My
[thesis][] title is: *The Texttiles browser: an experiment in rich-prospect
browsing for text collections*.

My research interests are visualisations, image processing and analysis, and
the role of semantic metadata in information sharing. I am also interested in
the web as an application platform to build environments that enhance
communication, foster institutional transparency, and enable the free flow of
information. I irregularly [post][] relevant links and updates about my
research.

I grew up in Ecuador, and I sometimes like to [comment][] (in Spanish)
on the media, and the quality of its discourse. I have a special
[section][] on articles that have absolute disregard for journalistic
principles and are just a calculated litany of stories meant to generate
emotional reactions.
