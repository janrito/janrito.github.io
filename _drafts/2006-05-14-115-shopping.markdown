Done. College. What did I get from it? ... not sure yet... Well, I probably did. I haven't goten sentimental yet. If there is something, however, that I know that I am going to miss, is this city. Boston has been my home for the four last years. I don't know when I am going to be back here.
I was taking a digital imaging class for the past semester, and for the last project, I decided to pay a little tribute to this wonderful city. enjoy...
