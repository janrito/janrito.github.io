[nature macro 3](http://www.flickr.com/photos/janrito/151994079/), originally uploaded by [Janrito Karamazov](http://www.flickr.com/people/janrito/).


My parents came up this past week, and we took a trip to the north of New Hampshire. There are several (or one huge) natural reserves in the area. My family has always loved to take trips into forests and mountains. We've always done this, since I remember. The only difference this time was that instead of hiking throught the high altitudes in the Ecuadorean Andes, the Ecuadorean rainforest, or some remote Pacific Ocean beach, we were in New Hampshire.
I have been in college for the past 4 years, and it is finaly over. My parents came up to see me graduate. Although this is supposed to be a happy situation, the bittersweetness of it is what comes accross most prominently. I'm soon leaving this place, and I'm sure I'm going to miss it. It's been a great 4 years. I know I complain, but i's been great.
This macro of a green leave fighting the rain in NH is one of a few rolls of photos i shot at this trip. Click on it and browse my flickr account for the rest.
