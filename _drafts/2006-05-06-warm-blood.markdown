I am so excited! It is very gratifying to find that others actually like your work. Especially because I have just started to explore photography, and don't have any formal training on it. Anyhow, [UTATA.org](http://www.utata.org) featured this photo on their front page, yesterday, may 5th. Here is what they wrote:


<blockquote>There is a special pleasure in standing barefooted on brick. The temperature of brick is always a bit out of step; it slowly absorbs the ambient temperature and is reluctant to release it. In the evening, brick retains the warmth of the day; in the late morning, brick holds fast to the cool of the night. Brick seems to know what bare feet want.

> 
> For more than five thousand years bricks have been made in essentially the same way, and to the same perfect 4:2:1 dimensions. The barefooted brickmakers of the Indus Valley Civilization would recognize and feel perfectly at home standing on the bricks of Boston or Brisbane, of Bogota or Berlin. The story of civilization is written in brick.

When you stand barefooted on brick, you become a living link between history and physics.
