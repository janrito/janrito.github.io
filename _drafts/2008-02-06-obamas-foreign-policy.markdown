[Barack Obama's foreign policy | Democracy in America | Economist.com](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2007/06/obama_sets_out_a_foreign_polic.cfm)

For some reason I am inclined to trust someone who has actually lived outside of the United States, not in diplomatic mission, or as a soldier, but actually lived, studied, interacted with people. A foreign policy by a person who has a world vision that is complex enough to understand other points of view, and to actually be able to identify himself with those who live under the mighty fist of American Interests.
