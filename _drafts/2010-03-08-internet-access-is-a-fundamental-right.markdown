<blockquote>The BBC survey found that 87% of internet users felt internet access should be the "fundamental right of all people".

via [BBC News - Internet access is 'a fundamental right'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8548190.stm).</blockquote>


This shows fundamental differences in perspective among citizens and politicians. While the majority of users agree that internet access is a right, regulators around the world are attacking it on several fronts: from censorship in Australia, China and Iran to three strikes laws in France and the UK.

It also outlines what governments should be striving for: universal broadband access (I know, Socialism!)
