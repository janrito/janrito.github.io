or Agoraphobia, for those of you who do not speak Spanish, and cannot easily translate such a complicated term, is the fear of being in open places. Outside. While I cannot imagine how it would be to be afraid of the outside, there is a deeper meaning that I can attach to this seemingly ridiculous fear, to which I can relate, intimately. I graduated from university just about a summer ago, and I have been traveling around and enjoying my life as an 'unoccupied" (read unemployed) adult. The reason that I was enjoying it was that it is normal for a student to spend the summer scratching his umbilicus and drinking beer, at least that's the way I did it, every summer, since I was 5 until this very last one.  Yet, it's now September and classes should have started. No classes for me, no schedule for me, still unemployed. I have the feeling I need to be following a calendar, that I have never seen.
I don't know where to start, I moved to a new city where I have no contacts, no family, no "role-model". I need to find a job, my resources are limited and will not stand for much longer. I need to start moving. I need to find something to do. Inactivity is killing me! I am a man with an empty resume, and a huge fear to be outside.
