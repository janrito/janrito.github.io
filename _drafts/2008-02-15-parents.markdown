[Movie Minutes: 'Parents' | New York Times Video](http://video.on.nytimes.com/?fr_story=8cb73b6d40309358ffeb4de2d05b7816f50739c5)

A great movie I saw a while ago. It gives you a perspective into a kind of multiculturalism that is different from what we're used to. It also has incredible insight into the general southamerican struggle for sovereignty, and independence.
