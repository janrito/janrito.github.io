This man was sleeping in front of the Boston Public Library, in Boylston Ave. His position not only looks funny, but also gives the impression of a deep fatigue. The bottles in the left suggest drunkenness, but I hope that is not the message that this image conveys.
Lately I've been experimenting with the use of negative space. It amazes me how powerful some photographs can be by leaving a great part of it empty, or almost empty. Also, it is incredible how this emptyness can radically change the  feeling of the whole composition. I think this photograph gains from the amount of negative space to the left of the man.
