I spent the summer in Europe. It was great. The only problem is that after three months of not having a regular schedule, it becomes hard to come back down and see the world through the eyes of somebody that does not have a trust fund, or some other type of unlimited fund.
This is one of the last photos I uploaded to flickr, and although I took many more, I haven't had the time to look at them, selecting and uploading. I'm not going to lie, it will probably continue like this for a little while.
On the other hand, following the transition that this site has had for the past month, there is going to be a redefinition of what this blog is going to be about. I cannot say yet, because I haven't made up my mind completely yet. However, I know that this blog is boring, and nobody will read it like this. So I have decided that if I am going to take the time to keep a blog, I have to make it interesting for other people and not only for myself.
