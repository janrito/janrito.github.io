[EE UU intenta que la UE acepte la presencia de agentes armados en los vuelos transoceánicos · ELPAÍS.com](http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/EE/UU/intenta/UE/acepte/presencia/agentes/armados/vuelos/transoceanicos/elpepuint/20080212elpepuint_12/Tes)

**...or "US requests approval from the EU the presence of armed agents in transatlantic flights"**

It is clear that the US is turning into - maybe it is already - a police state. By coercing the EU to accept new anti civil liberties regulations with the threat of visa requirements it seems to me that the US is only shooting itself on the foot. It is true that the unity of the EU has not proven to be mature yet, and the interests of the new EU members can play a big role in bilateral negotiations with the US. The new member states have not yet found their place on the European government and can fall short from understanding, or supporting bloc negotiations. They are not used to being big players in the grand scheme of things, and might see this as the opportunity to get some long awaited benefits from being in good terms with the US government.

On the other hand, the US is not in position right now to be cocky. Their economy does not resemble the American industrial machine of the past, and eight years of a diarrhea foreign policy has destroyed their image in the eyes of the world. Yet, again they make demands like a spoiled child, shouting aggressively and making threats.
