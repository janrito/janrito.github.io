This weekend marked the 3 year aniversary of the conflict in Iraq. There was a demonstration in Boston. It started in Dudley square, Roxbury, at 11am and it reached downtown about 4 hours later. The march was peaceful and with not many problems.
The kid in the photo was one of the protesters. Him, and many others were eager to be photographed, looking at the camera and making peace signs. In fact, there were quite a few people taking photos.
What strikes me about this image is not only the expression on his eyes, but the subtle smile, which is almos accidental. I chose to desaturate the colors because it gave the scene a warmer feel, and it kept some certain misteriousness that is suggested by the kid's expression.
