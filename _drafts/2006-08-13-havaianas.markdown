Havaianas have become one of my philosophies of life. They come from the happy people of Brazil, to every corner of the "globo". I recently learned that they were considered for a long time, the shoes of the pariahs. For a long time, nobody wanted to be seen in one of those. It was the alternative to no shoes: worn out havaianas. They slowly, slowly moved into being so ubiquitous. Today, they have managed to be considered the 'hip' flip flop in the stuck-up Bean Town (Boston).
Other than being the most comfortable footwear that you will ever find, Havaianas are loved also because of their ability to blend into your body as if they were part of it. They somehow manage to take a little part of you in every step you take, they will be a faithful portrait of yourself, and they will be your ultimate companion.
