I was walking today around the Westminster area. It was a really nice day, not at all the stereotypical London weather; it was sunny and the sky was blue. I had been walking for a while and I got thirsty so I entered the first bar that I saw and ordered a pint of beer. A Stella, if you care (fuck Budweiser). The waiter was an Indian guy called Taran, he poured my beer and gave me some salted almonds and cashews in a small dish.

I was telling the waiter that his name could be roughly taken for Gypsy in Romanian when a middle aged couple sat on the table next to me. It was an English guy with his Italian wife.<!-- more -->

The Italian wife made it clear to his husband that she absolutely needed a salted snack to accompany her white wine. The husband diligently came to the bar and took some. He was sitting back on his chair when he realized what he had done and came to me to apologize - “Sorry, I stole your nuts for my wife.”

I hadn’t noticed the interaction, but I quickly understood and said - “That is not a very nice thing to do.” He seemed confused for a moment, but tried to appease me - “They were very important for her.”

He didn’t get it. I paid for my beer and left.
