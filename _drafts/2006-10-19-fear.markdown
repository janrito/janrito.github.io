Recently we have heard a lot about how the George W. Bush administration uses scare tactics to bend the population's opinion about the current issues, or take away the attention of the people from the real issues. I thought that the efficiency of those tactics where limited to Americans. Americans have a very limited view of the world outside the United States. Americans see their politicians with auras of leadership and power, and are less likely to challenge their assertions. American politicians are not required to defend their positions, partly because the media has failed to ask the right questions, and part because Americans are not interested. American politics can run smoothly because most <!-- more -->Americans are apathetic toward their political state as long as they can read U.S. Weekly and watch Reality T.V. I do not mean to include all Americans in this group, as I know that not all of them are like this. However, it is a large enough group to guarantee the effectiveness of the fore mentioned methods.

My belief, however, was painfully challenged last weekend, during the elections for President of Ecuador. Particularly in the reactions of my most closely related individuals, after the announcement of the results of the first voting round. I saw in everybody frightened child unable to engage in any reasonable discussion, or even if - for a second - consider the possibility of being confused.

The election results came as everybody was expecting, with the two front runners on the top: Alvaro Noboa, and Rafael Correa. They will meet again on a run off for the Presidency on November 26th.  Now, I am not the one to say who is right or not for the job, but I would like to have at least a discussion, without the element of fear. Fitted violently into people's minds.

To such point has this fear been instilled in people's minds that they are willing to elect a candidate that they voted against last elections, electing a bodyguard for president. This candidate was not educated to be a president, and had taken part of a recent failed coup. A candidate who they overthrew in just a few months. Ecuador was willing to elect Lucio Gutierrez as it's president, before Alvaro Noboa. Why? Well, if I remember correctly, because he is the owner of the 'Big Banana' corporation, the biggest in the country. Big Banana which is known to use child labor and abuse human rights [[USLEAP](http://www.usleap.org/Banana/Noboa/AttackNL802.html),  [HRW](http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/04/25/ecuado3876.htm)]. Big Banana, known to intimidate, and threaten small competitors and farmer's unions [[HRW](http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/05/22/ecuado3997.htm)]. Big Banana who is well known to be a heavy tax dodger.
How is it possible that suddenly, this evil monster turned to being the option for this election. That's where the fun starts. The other candidate was labeled as communist... why? Because he is friends with the 'honorable' Hugo Chavez, President of Venezuela. It does not count that Rafael Correa is not only better educated than his adversary, but probably than any of the Presidents that Ecuador has had for the past 30 years, at institutions in the United States, and Belgium (not Cuba and China). It does not count the fact that he presents a clear plan, with clear objectives and methodologies. It does not count the fact that he is a well formed, well respected left thinker, in a country  where social programs are of the utmost importance. It does not count that Rafael Correa has provided documents denying that neither his campaign nor programs are being founded by Hugo Chavez or the Government of Venezuela. No, it matters that he is a communist, because he speaks no evil of a sister nation. And people are scared shitless...
