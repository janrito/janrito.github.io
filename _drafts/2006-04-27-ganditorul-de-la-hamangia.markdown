This is the second time I shoot these 'scene'. Last time I show just the male thinker, but I thought i'd give it a try with both.
On the technical side, I used the flash and a larger aperture this time, I wated to get a little bit more detail in background city, Boston. I also wanted to get more detail of the statues. Also in this shot I deliberately left in some of the window frame on the left side, and at the bottom where the statues are set. I did this so that the statues didn't seem to be floating in the air, in the middle of the city.
These statues are the thinkers of Hamagia. They are from some region in Romania, probably Hamangia. Even though their shapes are very exagerated human bodies, I love the way in which they convey the expression. They give a sensation of very deep contemplation. What are they thinking about? We don't know. I see them very often, and everytime I look at them, they seem to be thinking of something else.
Somebody at flickr said that they were ugly. I felt completely offended, and didn't respond. I have realized I have attached myself very much to the male statue.
I don't know what to think...
