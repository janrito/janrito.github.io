Spring is (almost) here! Over the past couple of weeks, there has been a bunch of warm days. This one being one of them. We decided to go to the beach, but as you can see, it wasn't warm enough to darken our nun-ass hue skin. However, it did provide a nice day for taking photographs at the beach. Revere beach is north from Boston. It is convenient because you can get there on the T (Boston's public transportation). The beach is not beautiful. But it serves the purpose.
This photo seems almost like I photoshoped her into the picture. The high-contrast creates a nice composition. The only think i am concerned about is the horizon crossing in the middle of her face. But that is a minor complaint. For me this image is almost as mysterious as it is happy. It raises questions,  but it also gives a nice cheerful feeling. Or maybe, I'm just happy that it's getting warmer.
