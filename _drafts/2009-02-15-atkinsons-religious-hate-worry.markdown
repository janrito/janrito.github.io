<blockquote>To criticise a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous but to criticise their religion, that is a right. That is a freedom.

The freedom to criticise ideas, any ideas - even if they are sincerely held beliefs - is one of the fundamental freedoms of society.

- via Rowan Atkinson, [BBC NEWS | UK | Politics | Atkinson's religious hate worry](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4073997.stm).</blockquote>
