The discourse around this new wave Socialism seems to be lost in the air. While some throw it around insultively, or mock it as a backwards soviet nostalgic utopia, many hold it up in the air looking at it with glaring eyes. Its proponents are fiercely attacked not only as yielding an radical undesirable ideology, but as being dishonorable, unethical and sinister; they are the inherent enemy of everything that is good, democratic and real.<!-- more -->




It certainly does not help that the maximum exposure of this undefined ideology are such divisive figures. However, there is a lack of an open and honest dialogue about the basic principles of what this Socialism of the XXI Century suposedly purports. This is a mistake in the parts of their leaders, but it does not undermine the movements value as a powerful agent of change. In fact, we can analyze, not its rhetoric, but its actions, and its early results. Or rather, analyze its rhetoric in the function of what it has produced.




I suspect we might find that the plea of this not-so-silent revolution is equality. Yet this plea for equality comes not from ideological abstractions from an ideological elite, but from a pragmatic community collectively working for what it claims it deserves. The face of constitutional changes and indignant dissent to the status quo is powered by a largely deprived and easily forgotten citizenry. A citizenry that simply demands to have fair and equal access to their own government, their own institutions, schools, resources, their country. The same citizenry in whose determination lies the authority of these institutions. They are demanding their right to these institutions which have been granted to them by all of the constitutions drafted before, and the ones that probably will be drafted in the future.




As a service to their own revolution, the leaders should learn how to pick their battles and fight for their ideals. However, making sure that the principles for which they are fighting be disseminated is important. Knowing that their fight is noble and possible is an incredible incentive.
